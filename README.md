Wrangle data from Twitter API and other sources

The aim of this project was to practice Data Wranging techniques. Data was gathered from several sources inlcuding:

- Local Files
- Downloading data from a URL
- Accessing data from an API - Twitter API for Python Tweepy.

The Data was then assessed and cleaned in prepartion for EDA.

The findings of the EDA were then summarised in a short report intended for a blog post.
